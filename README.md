# OpenAPI Conversation
I am working to better map out the technology, business, and politics of the OpenAPI community. I don't feel like things are in a healthy state, and need some nudging. While I want to encourage some technical investment, based upon my experience doing this over the last decade we are going to have to better understand the business and political landscape if we are going to make any movement when it comes to the OpenAPI specification itself, as well asl the services and tooling that put the specification to work.

## Working Areas
Here are the areas I am working on when it comes to mapping out the landscape, and trying to stimulate more investment in the OpenAPI specification, as well as the services and tooling that puts it to work.

- [Company Listing](companies.md) - List of all companies who are doing things with OpenAPI.
- [Service Listing](services.md) - List of all commercial services that use OpenAPI.
- [Tool Listing](tools.md) - List of all open source tooling that uses OpenAPI.
- [Feature Listing](features.md) - List of all features delivered by services and tools.
- [OpenAPI Feature Listing](openapi-features.md) - List of all the OpenAPI features available.

If you want to get involved, feel free to submit a GitHub issue with your thoughts, or submit a pull request on this repository. If you want to ping me directly you can email info@apievangelist.com, and I am happy to chat further about what I am trying to accomplish here.
